# A weekend trip to Alicante, Spain

Last weekend, on a whim, I flew from Helsinki to Alicante and stumbled upon an incredible travel hack that I just have to share. The secret? Scoring astonishingly affordable flights on Ryanair. The catch? Packing light enough to fit everything into an under-seat bag.

Preparation is key—remember to check in online and avoid the last-minute rush. The online check-in window snaps shut 2 hours before takeoff. Missed it? Brace yourself for a 50 euro fee at the airport check-in counter.

Dive into the vibrant hostel scene with platforms like Hostelworld and Booking.com at your fingertips. For those craving tranquility without breaking the bank, The Market Hostel Alicante emerges as a sanctuary. Revel in the comfort of their dormitory beds and embrace the quiet atmosphere, promising a serene retreat.

Alicante's charm isn't just for the summer sojourners. I ventured there on the last weekend of January, basking in a glorious 19°C and soaking up the sun. This city dazzles year-round, offering a blend of warm weather, vibrant culture, and scenic beaches.

Embrace the Alicante vibe—savor new dishes, forge connections, revel in the sunny days, stroll the beaches, plunge into swimming, and polish your Spanish. Here's a sneak peek at some handy phrases to enrich your Spanish escapade.
