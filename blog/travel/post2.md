# An Digital Nomadic experience in Hunza, Pakistan

In the summer of 2022, I embarked on a digital nomad adventure to Hunza, a mesmerizing valley in northern Pakistan. This wasn't just a trip; it was an experiment in blending work with the immersive experience of living in a new place, soaking up its culture, and connecting with its people.

The journey from Lahore to Hunza was a marathon of sorts, taking about 24 hours by bus. The route through the Shahrah-e-Karakoram unveiled breathtaking valleys, a prelude to the beauty that Hunza had to offer.

Hunza, a gem nestled in the heart of nature, became more than just a destination; it was a profound discovery. The quaint villages of Ganish, Altit, and Nasirabad served as my canvas for exploration. Each morning was beautifully inaugurated with Aslam Bhai's lovingly prepared breakfasts, perfectly setting the stage for a day balanced between diligent freelancing and invigorating adventures. This rhythm of work and wander was not just a routine but a meaningful journey into Hunza's verdant landscapes and its rich, pulsating local culture.

The warmth and unparalleled hospitality of Hunza envelop every visitor in a blanket of kindness and welcoming spirit, transforming each encounter into a feeling akin to coming home. Among the memorable connections I made, Aslam Bhai and Sky stand out as embodiments of this extraordinary warmth.

Aslam Bhai, the heart and soul behind the Tourist Cottage hotel, played a pivotal role in my daily life in Hunza. It was in his restaurant where I savored delicious meals, each dish a testament to his culinary prowess. Our conversations, filled with his stories, were not just exchanges but a window into the rich tapestry of local life. Aslam Bhai quickly evolved from being a host to a cherished friend, making my stay infinitely richer.

Sky, a Korean expatriate whose affection for Pakistan runs deep, became an irreplaceable ally in my travels. With a heart full of wanderlust and a soul resonating with love for the land, Sky shared his travel experiences in Pakistan. Each tale was a homage to his adventurous spirit and a profound respect for the country's rich tapestry of culture and natural beauty. Astonishingly, Sky's intimate knowledge of Pakistan's nooks and crannies, its stories and secrets, far exceeded my own—even as a native of the land.

Our evenings were magical, spent in the heart of Karimabad at a local graveyard that transformed at night into a serene viewpoint. Here, under the celestial theatre of starlit skies and the moon's soft glow casting its light on the towering peaks of Rakaposhi, Ultar and Diran. we found a tranquil retreat. Accompanied by music, our conversations meandered through our experiences, sharing and connecting in a setting that seemed almost surreal.

This unique blend of natural beauty, human connection, and cultural exchange in Hunza was not just memorable but transformative, highlighting the essence of travel as a journey of discovery, friendship, and profound personal growth.

Weekends were for deeper exploration. I remember biking to a Borith lake near Passu Cones, a journey along the Karakoram Highway that was an adventure in itself. The experience of driving through tunnels, with a reminder to check my bike lights to ward off the pitch-black darkness, added a thrill to the journey.

Accommodations in Hunza cater wonderfully to backpackers. I stayed at Haider Inn in Karimabad, which was not only affordable but became even more so with a longer stay. Nearby, Old Hunza Inn and Tourist Cottage offered similarly welcoming and budget-friendly options. The hospitality here is heartfelt, especially the meals prepared by Aslam Bhai at the Tourist Cottage—a taste of home in every bite.

Working remotely from Hunza was surprisingly smooth, thanks to reliable 4G internet. The only hiccup was the frequent power outages, but with UPS backups available, my work remained uninterrupted.

This month-long stay in Hunza was more than just a trip; it was a life-enriching journey that blended work, culture, and adventure, showcasing the beauty of adopting a digital nomad lifestyle in one of the world's most stunning landscapes.
