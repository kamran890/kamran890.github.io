# Adapting to Change: The Adapter Pattern in Python

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It involves creating an adapter that 'adapts' the interface of one class (the adaptee) to another interface (the target) that the client expects.

## Simple Example in Python

Consider an application that uses a specific logging interface, but needs to integrate with a third-party logging service having a different interface.

```python
# The Adaptee (Third-Party Logging Service)
class ThirdPartyLogger:
    def log_message(self, level, message):
        # Implementation for logging messages
        pass

# The Target Interface (Application's Logger)
class ApplicationLogger:
    def error(self, message):
        pass

    def info(self, message):
        pass

# The Adapter
class LoggerAdapter(ApplicationLogger):
    def __init__(self, third_party_logger):
        self.third_party_logger = third_party_logger

    def error(self, message):
        self.third_party_logger.log_message("ERROR", message)

    def info(self, message):
        self.third_party_logger.log_message("INFO", message)

# Using the Adapter
external_logger = ThirdPartyLogger()
app_logger = LoggerAdapter(external_logger)
app_logger.error("Error occurred")
app_logger.info("Information logged")
```

LoggerAdapter makes the ThirdPartyLogger compatible with the ApplicationLogger interface, enabling seamless integration.

## Pros:

- Compatibility: Enables communication between objects with incompatible interfaces.
- Reusability: Allows existing classes or external systems to be reused without modifying their source code.
- Flexibility: The client code can work with different adaptees via a common interface.

## Cons:

- Complexity: Introduces additional layers and complexity to the code.
- Indirect Communication: Can lead to inefficiencies due to indirect communication between client and adaptee.
- Maintenance: The adapter code needs to be maintained in parallel with changes in the adaptee's interface.
